	<h2>Experience</h2>
	
	<h5>Founder</h5>
	<h5><b>Cloudflyer, Wizzmap</b> - Toronto</h5>
	<h5>November 2012  to Current</h5>
	<p>In the fall of 2012 I left TD to start Wizzmap, and then Cloudflyer. I designed and built two startups that ultimately failed but were worthwhile to my own developement.</p>
	<br />

	<p>Over ten years at TD, I held various roles: Site Manager, Information Architect, Content Specialist, Business Analyst. When I began at TD I worked as a Service Availabilty Rep i a 24/7 data center, and when I left I managed the retail portion of the TD Intranet (B-Web).

	<h4>Cloudflyer</h4>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.wizzmap.com">Wizzmap</a> is a way to collect and share geographic points on a map. Users can save map data, create collections and comine collections with other users. It was an attempt to create networked data points rather than users.
