	<h2>Experience</h2>
	
	<h5>Founder</h5>
	<h5><b>Cloudflyer, Wizzmap</b></h5>
	<h5>November 2012  to current</h5>
	<p>In the fall of 2012 I left TD to start Wizzmap, and then Cloudflyer the following year. Both of these startups  ultimately failed, but have provided me with lessons and experience that I know apply to new projects.</p>
	<br />
	<h5>Site Manager, Information Architect</h5>
	<h5><b>TD Bank</b></h5>
	<h5>2002 to November 2012</h5>
	<p>Over ten years at TD, I held various roles: Site Manager, Information Architect, Content Specialist and Business Analyst. When I began at TD I worked as a Service Availability Rep in a 24/7 data center, I left managing the retail portion of the TD Intranet (B-Web).
	</p>
	Some of the projects I worked on include: 
		<ul>
			<li>Bank wide roll out of IBM Connections</li>
			<li>Search interface rebuild</li>
			<li>Content strategy and management for 100,000 page Intranet</li>
			<li>Design of content targeting system</li>
			<li>Site builds and redesigns</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Recent Projects</h2>
	<h4>Cloudflyer</h4>
	<p>
		<a href="http://hoodboom.herokuapp.com">Cloudflyer.ca</a> was a startup I founded, designed and coded. It enabled locally focused merchants to create a web profile and market that profile to a local audience.
		<a href="cloud.html">I've written about the experience.</a>

	</p>

	<h4>Wizzmap</h4>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.wizzmap.com">Wizzmap</a> is a way to collect and share geographic points on a map. Users can save map data, create collections and combine collections with other users. It was an attempt to create networked data points rather than users.
