				<h2>About</h2>
				<img src="images/soundblocks.png" id="cf-image" class="img-left">
				<p>SoundBlocks launched for iOS on April 10, 2017.</p>
				<p>Imagine a recording studio built out of brightly colored children's blocks.  
                    Sound and music are blocks of color. Alter the sounds by stretching the block. 
                    Drag the blocks into different configurations, build a soundscape out of colors.
                    This is the concept behind SoundBlocks. A simple and intuitive way to record, manipulate 
                    and combine audio clips. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recording sounds is simple, hold down the record button and when you are finished the clip is 
                    shown as a colored block. Stretch  or squeeze the blocks to change their pitch. Compress or expand 
                    them to distort them in different ways. You can combine blocks into sequences by dragging the 
                    blocks into the tracks at the bottom of the screen.
                </p>
