	<h1>Cloudflyer</h1>
	<p>
		During the fall and winter of 2013/14 I designed and built a startup called Cloudflyer.ca

	</p>
	
	<h3>Design</h3>
	<p>
		In the late summer of 2013, while sitting on a park bench, I watched a man give proffesional frisbee instrucions.
		"That's a small niche" I thought. "I wonder how he advertises, finds a market?".
	</p>
	<p>
		The thesis was this: Small independent entrepreneurs have trouble marketing to local audiences online.
	</p>

	<br />
	<h3>Build</h3>
	<p>
		Cloudflyer is a Rails app. Early designs were all paper based and then moved directly to code. By working in the browser the design, functionality and program design could all eveolve in parallel. This allowed rapid iteration and was efficient, however there were drawbacks as I'll mention below.

		Two sepperate user models were used. One for merchants and one for shoppers. 

	</p>

	<br />
	<h3>Failure</h3>
	<p>
		Cloudflyer failed becasue no merchants signed up. But the reasons for this I've broken down as such.
		<ol>
			<li><b>Market Fit</b><br />
				There needs to be a clear benefit for a user to take action. Cloudflyer did not address this.
			</li>
			<li><b>Marketing Strength</b><br />
				A strong marketing effort is essential for any success. We did not have this.</li>
		</ol>
