	<h1>Cloudflyer</h1>
	<p>
		During the fall and winter of 2013/14 I designed and built a startup called Cloudflyer.ca

	<h3>Design</h3>
	<p>
		In the late summer of 2013, sitting on a park bench, I watched a man give proffesional frisbee instrucions. 
		"That's a small niche" I thought. Then I thought "I wonder how he advertises?".

	</p>
	<p>
		The thesis was: Small independent entrepreneurs have trouble marketing to local audiences online.
	</p>


	<h3>Build</h3>
	<p>
		Cloudflyer was built on Rails. Paper skeches to code, no intermediary design steps were taken

	</p>


	<h3>Failure</h3>
	<p>
		During the fall and winter of 2013/14 I designed and built a startup called Cloudflyer.ca
